             <h2>Overall Reflection</h2>
             <p id='summary'>After taking this course, my eyes have been opened to many new ideas and  concepts that I haven't really thought of or just added on to the ideas I already followed by. To me AP Bio was the next step from living environment.  I didn't fully take the living environment course but there were ideas that were revisited but expanded upon. We all know our bodies are made up of millions of tiny cells. These cells make up our hearts, liver, skin, etc. Each tiny little cell has a world within itself that controls and contains genetic material that make up who we are. This genetic material that is stored in each nucleus of a cell contains instructions of what the function of that cell is. In reality, our bodies are made up of a million little tiny bodies that have different functions but work together to function you. I'm not one person but millions of tiny living organisms that get affected whether it be the environment or random mutations . When it's cold I shiver. When it's hot I sweat. These are all just my body signally to me that it is trying to maintain homeostasis- the process of stabilizing the body's inner environment  based on the changes of the outer environment. What about when I get sick? My body's immune system fights off the bacteria or virus that is trying to sicken me. White blood cells go to war everyday and all day to make sure I don’t get sick. What about medicine? Yes, I can take medicine but is it necessary.  Most of the world's antibiotics go to the animals we eat, the fruit we eat, the drinks we drink and perhaps the air we inhale. Nowadays most bacteria are immune to us and don't respond to the antibiotics given  meaning they've evolved and have become stronger. I believe in my body and all the tiny people that make me who I am. They are strong enough to fight back. But when the time comes and the need for backup is urgent than I can count on medicine to give a helping hand.

                    <p id="summary">It may not be something we learned in a lesson but was taught through a pogil in preparation for the AP Biology Exam. Going through the pogil and understanding the use of the Hardy Weinberg Equation was clear but how to actually substitute for numbers was confusing me. I wasn't sure what the variables p and q stood for or where to actually get the values for them. It may have been that I was thinking too hard about what the question was asking but when completing the worksheets after the pogil it made more sense and I felt that I had a grasp on how to actually complete the equation and find the percent of each allele. The Hardy Weinberg Equation reflects a time when a lightbulb went on.

            <h2>Category 5: "What I learned but STILL don't Understand"!</h2>
            <h3>Cell Signaling</h3>

                </a>
                <p id="summary">Cell signaling was taught in the first half of the school year. I feel that learning about cell signaling and its functions went in one ear and out the other. There were many new vocabulary words in this chapter of AP Bio that I didn't understand no matter how many times I try to read it. For example, when reading the Campbell biology book it talked about G proteins. I believe that G proteins are what carry the hormones in and out cells.  We watched a video about cell signaling and its process by the science guy. Maybe I wasn't paying attention to the video or it was going to fast but it sounded like it was in a foriegn language that I didn't understand and that was science. If I were to review it, I may be able to understand it better now with a clear head and focused eyes.</p>
            <h3>Pedigree Chart</h3>

                </a>
                <p id="summary">Learning about pedigrees and how to read them was probably one of my favorite lessons in the whole school year even if I haven't quite grasped it. I believe I've seen them before in 8th grade but didn't go into detail before this year. What trips me up about pedigrees are figuring out how a disease is inherited, who is a carrier or the percentage the offspring has of inheriting the disease. The reason being is that there isn't much information given in the charts besides that key that tells you whether the shape is a male, female, affected, unaffected and the generations being presented. Reading these pedigrees requires skill in making observations, making inferences and drawing conclusions. These are skills that I am currently weak in and need to improve upon when trying to read pedigrees.

                </a>
                <p id="summary">Cancer is something that affects people in the world and can potentially affect us any day of our lives randomly. Learning about the Biology of Cancer and what is it has shown us how cancer can affect society in different ways. We all have a basic understanding that Cancer is life threatening and there's not really a cure but treatments you  can take to get rid of cancer. What makes cancer cancer is something that was taught in class. I had the basic understanding that cancer was caused by a mutation but didn't have a full understanding of how the mutations were caused and how it affects the cells in other parts of the body. As part of the lesson we watched a video that explained to us statistics wise cancer and those it affected. I learned that at least 1 in 2 men get cancer and 1 in 3 women get cancer. It isn't only one type of mutation that qualifies cells as cancer but 6 key mutations and I feel that this is important to know and understand these mutations connecting them to the real world.
            <h2>Category 9: "Topic I enjoyed learning MOST"!</h2>
                <a target="_blank" href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1R85isuwc-S676GEt_WvJzplrAWhHKtJD-4kry2GEeTg/edit?usp=sharing">

                </a>
                <p id="summary">Learning about Genetic disorders, how they are inherited and the biology behind them has been my favorite lesson this whole year. To continue on the lesson of mutations and cancer we discussed how mutations in genetic material can be leads to disorders that can potentially be life threatening. For this unit we were asked to work in teams to research a certain genetic disorder, learn what it is, how it is inherited, what are its effects and teach the class about it. At first I didn't like the idea of self-taught and having the students teach each other because that meant getting up and presenting something to the whole class. After having Mr. Jansen randomly choose the genetic disorder and doing research it became more interesting to the point where I enjoyed it, felt that I have learned something and gained confidence in my skills to present even if it wasn't in front of the whole class.
